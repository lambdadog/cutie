* Cutie

An IRC bot built for Haskell learning purposes.

It's designed for a friend's IRC server, running Oragono 1.0.0, so it
may have some idiosyncracies related to that, but I'll try to note
them in a comment where I remember to.

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ git clone https://github.com/transitracer/cutie
$ stack install # make sure stack installs to your PATH
$ # To run (anywhere):
$ cutie
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, if you don't want to install to your PATH and keep it
self contained, you can just build it and run it with stack:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ git clone https://github.com/transitracer/cutie
$ stack build
$ # To run (in the repository):
$ stack run
#+END_SRC
